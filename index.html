  <h1>The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.</h1>
  <p>Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them. Partially, but it also obeys your commands. Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.</p>
  <p>Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny.
    It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense. Ye-ha!</p>
  <h2>Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him.</h2>
  <p>I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base. I care. So, what do you think of her, Han? As you wish. Don't underestimate the Force.</p>
  <ol>

    <li>A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.</li>
    <li>I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me.</li>
    <li>I care. So, what do you think of her, Han?</li>

  </ol>

  <h3>You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away!</h3>
  <p>I don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan-- Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is.</p>
  <ul>

    <li>She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time!</li>
    <li>Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think?</li>
    <li>Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone.</li>

  </ul>

  <p>Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time!</p>
  <p>Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. What?! I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here.</p>
  <p>I care. So, what do you think of her, Han? Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight?</p>
  <p>The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers. As you wish. Ye-ha! Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed.</p>
  <p>The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is. Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is.</p>
  <p>Ye-ha! I care. So, what do you think of her, Han? No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly… You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away! But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed
    to fight?</p>
  <p>But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight? Don't underestimate the Force. I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct.</p>
  <p>Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you. The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more
    star systems will slip through your fingers.</p>
  <p>What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like…suicide. As you wish. A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.</p>
  <p>Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. I care. So, what do you think of her, Han? The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. You don't believe in the Force, do you?</p>
  <p>The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. Dantooine. They're on Dantooine. Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed. You mean it controls your actions?</p>

  <p>Ye-ha! I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base. In my experience, there is no such thing as luck.</p>
