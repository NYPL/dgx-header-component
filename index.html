      <h1>Wizard of Oz</h1>
      
      <p>"Full of courage," replied the Lion, who went joyfully back to his friends to tell them of his good fortune.</p>

      <p>Oz, left to himself, smiled to think of his success in giving the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman and the Lion exactly what they thought they wanted.  "How can I help being a humbug," he said, "when all these people make me do things that everybody knows can't be done?  It was easy to make the Scarecrow and the Lion and the Woodman happy, because they imagined I could do anything.  But it will take more than imagination to carry Dorothy back to Kansas, and I'm sure I don't know how it can be done."</p>

      <p>For three days Dorothy heard nothing from Oz.  These were sad days for the little girl, although her friends were all quite happy and contented.  The Scarecrow told them there were wonderful thoughts in his head; but he would not say what they were because he knew no one could understand them but himself.  When the Tin Woodman walked about he felt his heart rattling around in his breast; and he told Dorothy he had discovered it to be a kinder and more tender heart than the one he had owned when he was made of flesh.  The Lion declared he was afraid of nothing on earth, and would gladly face an army or a dozen of the fierce Kalidahs.</p>

      <p>Thus each of the little party was satisfied except Dorothy, who longed more than ever to get back to Kansas.</p>

      <p>On the fourth day, to her great joy, Oz sent for her, and when she entered the Throne Room he greeted her pleasantly:</p>

      <p>"Sit down, my dear; I think I have found the way to get you out of this country."</p>

      <p>"And back to Kansas?" she asked eagerly.</p>

      <p>"Well, I'm not sure about Kansas," said Oz, "for I haven't the faintest notion which way it lies.  But the first thing to do is to cross the desert, and then it should be easy to find your way home."</p>

      <p>"How can I cross the desert?" she inquired.</p>

      <p>"Well, I'll tell you what I think," said the little man.  "You see, when I came to this country it was in a balloon.  You also came through the air, being carried by a cyclone.  So I believe the best way to get across the desert will be through the air.  Now, it is quite beyond my powers to make a cyclone; but I've been thinking the matter over, and I believe I can make a balloon."</p>

      <h1>Moby Dick</h1>

      <p id="maincontent" tabindex="-1">Upon this, he told me another story. The people of his island of Rokovoko, it seems, at their wedding feasts express the fragrant water of young cocoanuts into a large stained calabash like a punchbowl; and this punchbowl always forms the great central ornament on the braided mat where the feast is held. Now a certain grand merchant ship once touched at Rokovoko, and its commander&mdash;from all accounts, a very stately punctilious gentleman, at least for a sea captain&mdash;this commander was invited to the wedding feast of Queequeg's sister, a pretty young princess just turned of ten. Well; when all the wedding guests were assembled at the bride's bamboo cottage, this Captain marches in, and being assigned the post of honour, placed himself over against the punchbowl, and between the High Priest and his majesty the King, Queequeg's father. Grace being said,&mdash;for those people have their grace as well as we&mdash;though Queequeg told me that unlike us, who at such times look downwards to our platters, they, on the contrary, copying the ducks, glance upwards to the great Giver of all feasts&mdash;Grace, I say, being said, the High Priest opens the banquet by the immemorial ceremony of the island; that is, dipping his consecrated and consecrating fingers into the bowl before the blessed beverage circulates. Seeing himself placed next the Priest, and noting the ceremony, and thinking himself&mdash;being Captain of a ship&mdash;as having plain precedence over a mere island King, especially in the King's own house&mdash;the Captain coolly proceeds to wash his hands in the punchbowl;&mdash;taking it I suppose for a huge finger-glass. "Now," said Queequeg, "what you tink now?&mdash;Didn't our people laugh?"</p>

      <p>At last, passage paid, and luggage safe, we stood on board the schooner. Hoisting sail, it glided down the Acushnet river. On one side, New Bedford rose in terraces of streets, their ice-covered trees all glittering in the clear, cold air. Huge hills and mountains of casks on casks were piled upon her wharves, and side by side the world-wandering whale ships lay silent and safely moored at last; while from others came a sound of carpenters and coopers, with blended noises of fires and forges to melt the pitch, all betokening that new cruises were on the start; that one most perilous and long voyage ended, only begins a second; and a second ended, only begins a third, and so on, for ever and for aye. Such is the endlessness, yea, the intolerableness of all earthly effort.</p>

      <p>Gaining the more open water, the bracing breeze waxed fresh; the little Moss tossed the quick foam from her bows, as a young colt his snortings. How I snuffed that Tartar air!&mdash;how I spurned that turnpike earth!&mdash;that common highway all over dented with the marks of slavish heels and hoofs; and turned me to admire the magnanimity of the sea which will permit no records.</p>

      <p>At the same foam-fountain, Queequeg seemed to drink and reel with me. His dusky nostrils swelled apart; he showed his filed and pointed teeth. On, on we flew; and our offing gained, the Moss did homage to the blast; ducked and dived her bows as a slave before the Sultan. Sideways leaning, we sideways darted; every ropeyarn tingling like a wire; the two tall masts buckling like Indian canes in land tornadoes. So full of this reeling scene were we, as we stood by the plunging bowsprit, that for some time we did not notice the jeering glances of the passengers, a lubber-like assembly, who marvelled that two fellow beings should be so companionable; as though a white man were anything more dignified than a whitewashed negro. But there were some boobies and bumpkins there, who, by their intense greenness, must have come from the heart and centre of all verdure. Queequeg caught one of these young saplings mimicking him behind his back. I thought the bumpkin's hour of doom was come. Dropping his harpoon, the brawny savage caught him in his arms, and by an almost miraculous dexterity and strength, sent him high up bodily into the air; then slightly tapping his stern in mid-somerset, the fellow landed with bursting lungs upon his feet, while Queequeg, turning his back upon him, lighted his tomahawk pipe and passed it to me for a puff.</p>

      <p>"Capting! Capting!" yelled the bumpkin, running towards that officer; "Capting, Capting, here's the devil."</p>

      <p></p>
      
      <p>"What him say?" said Queequeg, as he mildly turned to me.</p>

      <p>"He say," said I, "that you came near kill-e that man there," pointing to the still shivering greenhorn.</p>

      <p>"Kill-e," cried Queequeg, twisting his tattooed face into an unearthly expression of disdain, "ah! him bevy small-e fish-e; Queequeg no kill-e so small-e fish-e; Queequeg kill-e big whale!"</p>

      <p>"Look you," roared the Captain, "I'll kill-e YOU, you cannibal, if you try any more of your tricks aboard here; so mind your eye."</p>
